# TestHelpers

These sources adapted from Visual Studio 2019's `Analyzer with Code Fix (.NET Standard)` project template.
Most notably:

* References to MSTest were replaced with [NUnit](https://nunit.org/).
* Code for VisualBasic.NET was removed.

Refer to the [Roslyn SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-sdk) for details.
